After waiting for approximately 20 minutes,we went over counter and ask if the chicken laksa is ready? We were informed that they had run out of steamed chicken and asked if we would accept roasted chicken instead. We agreed, but unfortunately, when the laksa was served, the laksa was tasteless and the noodles were overcooked, resembling soggy, flavorless strands. We were unable to finish our meal due to the poor quality.\\n\\nWe were disappointed and surprised by the significant decline in taste and quality compared to our previous experiences at this establishment. I hope the management takes our feedback seriously and takes necessary steps to address these issues.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter."\nlanguage_code: "en"\n'},

As someone who enjoys a good plate of cai png (economy rice), I was hopeful to enjoy a satisfying meal, but my expectations were quickly shattered. Upon arriving at the stall, I noticed that the server auntie was someone new. Unfortunately, her lack of experience was evident from the moment she started serving. As she picked the vegetables using the tongs, she seemed to lack finesse and care, resulting in a rather clumsy and careless approach. It was disheartening to see her smacking the tongs into the rice box, as if she were preparing to feed pigs, rather than serving paying customers. The first disappointment came when I tasted the vegetables. To my dismay, they were completely uncooked and had an overwhelming bitter taste. It was clear that the food had not been properly prepared or cooked to an acceptable standard. This lack of attention to detail was deeply disappointing, as I expected the vegetables to be fresh, flavorful, and cooked. As a paying customer, I believe it is important to receive a quality meal that meets reasonable expectations. The combination of uncooked and bitter vegetables, along with the server auntie\\\'s careless attitude, left a lasting negative impression. I sincerely hope that the management takes this feedback into consideration and works towards improving their food quality and service standards. While everyone deserves a chance to learn and grow, it is crucial to prioritize the customer experience and ensure that each visit to the stall is enjoyable and satisfying."\nlanguage_code: "en"\n'},

Personally I like the economic rice stall, mala hotpot stall, and the Bah Kut Teh (Malaysia herbal style).\\n\\n(Update 2024/April) The economic rice (za cai fan) stall is now cooked and served by the duo formerly from Punggol 312A (across Punggol Cove Pri School). Food is very tasty, not too salty, and portion is *GENEROUS*. Have tried many za cai fan stalls around Punggol and I can say this is the best you\\\'ll find in Punggol.\\n\\nThere\\\'s also a Claypot chicken stall.

We\\\'d been here before for kway chap and were intrigued by the wanton mee stall that looked so inviting.  We were hoping for a delicious meal to fuel us up before our ride.  Kitty ordered the wanton mee, and she actually enjoyed it.  She said the noodles were good quality, and the overall flavor was good.\\n\\nI, on the other hand, ordered the shrimp dumpling mee and wasn\\\'t as impressed.  The noodles were good quality, but the soup was lukewarm, and I felt the seasoning was lacking.  It felt a little bland overall. The shrimp dumplings were tasty, though.  The prawn crackers and char siu were also good, but I found the wantons themselves to be less impressive compared to other places I\\\'ve tried.\\n\\nOverall, while the food wasn\\\'t bad, I think Tanjong Rhu Wanton Noodle has room for improvement.

My guess is that their stall is not earning enough to cover stall rental cost. My wish is for this stall to close for good. I feel for those customers who have to endure the male staff arrogant and rude attitude.\\n\\nMale staff in spectacle have a serious attitude problem. When asked for some pork belly gravy on the rice, he only gives you a teaspoon of the sauce reluctantly, so i asked him nicely for a bit more and he can rudely tell you they do not have enough even though they have the whole pot. I merely ask for some gravy on the rice and not that I am asking for a whole bowl of it. At this rate, I hope this stall will close for good.\\n\\nTo the owner or franchisee, I strongly urge you to seriously look into this matter as I am not the only one expressing displeasure with the staff who are consistently receiving bad reviews from many unhappy customers.\\n\\nI enjoy good food, but I do not appreciate staff with bad service mentality.
